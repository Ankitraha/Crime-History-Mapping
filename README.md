# Crime History Mapping

Crime mapping is a critical tool for law enforcement agencies and communities to understand and combat criminal activities. This project provides a Python-based solution using the Folium library to create an interactive crime history mapping visualization. With this tool, you can effectively visualize crime occurrences, identify dangerous areas, and analyze crime data based on location.
